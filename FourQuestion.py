Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class (called a derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a base or parent class). This facilitates code reuse, promotes a hierarchical relationship between classes, and allows for creating new classes with shared characteristics of existing ones.

There are different types of inheritance:

1. Single Inheritance:
In single inheritance, a class inherits properties and behaviors from a single parent class.
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

2.Multiple Inheritance:
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes.
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Flyable:
    def fly(self):
        pass

class Bird(Animal, Flyable):
    def sound(self):
        print("Chirp")
        
bird = Bird()
bird.sound()  
bird.fly()    

3.Multilevel Inheritance:
Multilevel inheritance involves a chain of inheritance where a derived class inherits from a base class and another class derives from that derived class, forming a hierarchy.
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Bulldog(Dog):
    def guard(self):
        print("Guarding")

bulldog = Bulldog()
bulldog.sound()  
bulldog.guard()
