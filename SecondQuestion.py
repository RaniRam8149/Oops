Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example
The __init__() function in Python is a special method used in classes to initialize new objects. It stands for "initialize" and is called automatically whenever a new instance of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to set up initial attributes or perform any necessary actions required when an object is instantiated.
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old."

person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

print(person1.greet()) 
print(person2.greet())
