Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?
In object-oriented programming (OOP), self refers to the instance of the class itself. It's a way for objects to refer to themselves within the class and access their own attributes and methods.

In Python (and in some other object-oriented languages), self is the conventional name used to represent the instance of the class. When you define methods within a class, you must explicitly include self as the first parameter of those methods.

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def print_value(self):
        print(self.value)

obj = MyClass(10)
obj.print_value()
